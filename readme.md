Tired of agonizing of which restaurant to choose? Angry with the Algorithms that just don't get *you*? Are you just hungry? Let's just eat is here for you!

Let's Just Eat will choose a random restaurant within walking or driving distance of your current location. This could be a Mcdonalds or a  Michelin star restaurant. 

# Learnings

I built this project to improve my design skills, play with the Google Maps API, and further my learning of vanilla js. This was my first time using Figma on one of my own projects. This is obviously a very simple site, but that made it an excellent way to learn the ins and outs of Figma. I used the Google places api and a dynamically generated url for the directions. 


# Todo:
- [ ] Dynamically change from walking to driving depending on route time
- [ ] Adjust the Search radius if no results are found
- [ ] Only return open establishments
- [ ] buy domain name (HA!)
- [ ] Add a title
- [ ] Add a share button
